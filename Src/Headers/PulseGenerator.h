// To divide the NOMINAL_CLOCK_FREQ by before passing it to
// the PWM peripheral.  Trying to nominally time the PWM
// such that 32 clocks is 1 �sec or 31.25 MHz clock.
// Clocks to write a FIFO byte is determined by RNG1 of
// the PWM.  Not documented but I have found that RNG1
// takes  a few clocks to take effect so the duration field
// set by RNG1 is one pulse segment ahead of its state...
//
// Don't know if a full word is required but that is why I
// chose 32 bits for 1 �sec just in case...
//
// This is the divider which should be passed to
// Clock::PwmSetDivider(int divider)
//
// Also assumes base clock is (running at 500MHz undivided)
#define CLOCK_DIV 16

// Use this to "dial in" the timing to you desitred accuracy.
//
// i.e using these default settings I get 31.25 MHz base clock
// rate.  In an ideal world this would mean a RING1 of 312
// will produce pulse segments of 10 �sec.  On my RPI I measured
// a pulse segment duration of 10.45 �sec. Similarly, a 624
// value for RNG1 produced 20.90 �sec.  To get exactly 10 �sec
// I need 4 fewer PWM clocks for a difference of 0.4 MHz.
// I can adjust the ideal timing to actual conditions with
// the following constant..
// Well... Then after upgrading to the same PI to strech the
// timing was off.  Therefore I'm just introducing a slope
// and offset so that timing can be corrected.
// After stretch upgrade I found the following data:
// Measured	 desired �sec
// 172	     58
// 293	     100
// 1488	     500
// Leading to these claibration constants: (your setup may
// require a different constant if �sec timing is required
// for your application.
